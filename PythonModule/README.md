StreetPerfect Python client - XPC native and HTTP

This is the StreetPerfect Python Client module. You can build this wheel by running the build_dist_package.cmd batch file.

Then install it using pip:

pip install streetperfect-11.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

This client allows you to connect to a StreetPerfect server via the propreitary StreetPerfect XPC protocol. 
Both the Windows and Linux XPC libs are installed.

You can also use the HTTP client which allows you to access the StreetPerfect API SaaS servers.
The HTTP client is also avaliable for LAN use to a local StreetPerfect server instance.

Alternately you can load the client from the StreetPerfect folder without installing the module in python.

Python 3 required.
